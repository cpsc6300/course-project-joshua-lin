# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation
This should be a brief and self-contained decription of the problem that your project aims to solve and what motivated you to solve this problem.

Using a dataset from the Titanic, this project will find out which passengers survived the Titanic and which traits these passengers gneerally had. This will be used to make a prediction about what type of passengers survived the Titanic (rich, poor, male, female, age, race, etc.).

## Introduction and Description of Data
Description of relevant knowledge. Why is this problem important? Why is it challenging? Introduce the motivations for the project question and how that question was defined through preliminary EDA.

This problem will show who survived in the Titanic, allowing conclusions to be drawn about which groups of people in the early 1900s had priority in surviving the Titanic. It could be the wealthy, the children, the women, the men, or even other traits that were never considered. To explore this question, we will be examining all the traits of the people who survived, the quantity of those people who survived of each trait, the combination of traits of the people who survived, and finally the percentage of each trait/combination of people who survived.

# Plan
This could include the major timeline and milestones of your project as well as requirements of computing and storage resources.

1. Prepare data.
2. Analyze and identify patterns through exploring the data.
3. Using models, make predictions of people who survived.
4. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.

# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation

When people are in a panic, the reactions and actions done are always different than if they were in a normal state of mind. By using a dataset from the Titanic of the people who survived, this project will find out which passengers survived the Titanic and which traits these passengers generally had. By finding out the types of people who survived, we can see whether people's mindset during the crisis would change. For example, will the men mostly let the women and children on the boats first, or was the rich prioritized. Was racism so bad that during the crisis they would not let any black men or women either?

## Introduction and Description of Data
Description of relevant knowledge. Why is this problem important? Why is it challenging? Introduce the motivations for the project question and how that question was defined through preliminary EDA.

The data will be of the people who survived the Titanic and any relevant data corresponding to these people. This problem will show who survived in the Titanic, allowing conclusions to be drawn about which groups of people in the early 1900s had priority in surviving the Titanic and whether racism and other prevelent thoughts were still the same during a crisis. To explore this question, we will be examining all the traits of the people who survived, the quantity of those people who survived of each trait, the combination of traits of the people who survived, and finally the percentage of each trait/combination of people who survived.

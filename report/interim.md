# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation
This project aims to see whether the prejudices or advantages that certain groups in the 1900s had were the main reasons certain groups survived the Titanic. To achieve this, we will be using a data set of a portion of the passengers on the Titanic. The data of these passengers will involve their age, gender, social economic class, and whether they survived. We will create a model using this dataset which will predict which groups of people generall survived the Titanic.

## Introduction and Description of Data
During the early 1900s, one of the most famous shipweaks occured: the sinking of the Titanic. During this time, the Titanic did not have enough lifeboats for everyone to board, resulting in about 3/4 of the 2224 passengers and crew to die. While luck was definitely involved for some's survival, some groups definitely had some advantages which led to more of them to survive than others. This project aims to develop a model that predicts which groups of people survived through this traits. These traits can help reveal whether the prejudices or advantages that certain groups in the 1900s had were the main reasons certain groups survived the Titanic.

## Interim Results
I do not have any reportable findings. I have been trying to clean the data which has taken me longer than I expected because there have been many things to clean/converte, more than I anticipated at the beginning.

# Project Progress
1. Prepare data - November 25
2. Analyze and identify patterns through exploring the data - November 28
3. Using models, make predictions of people who survived - November 30
4. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution - December 1

I started this project much later than I expected due to a sudden huge amount of tests and projects in my other classes. I have only recently been able to start cleaning the data, but I soon realized that outside of just converting categorical data into numerical types, I also had to handle missing values. To overcome theses issues, I just need to make sure I work on this project every day to finish it. If I spend enough time on this project, I should be able to finish it on time.I just need to make sure I do not drag out this project any longer than I have already.
